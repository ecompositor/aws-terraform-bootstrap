# These variables are also used to run the app locally, but are duplicates of certain "TF_VAR"-prefixed variables, because
# Terraform strips "TF_VAR" from the variables and then in terraform/lambda.tf, those variables are set as the lambda
# environment variables. Locally, "TF_VAR" won't be stripped. It's ugly to have to duplicate these variables but that's
# the solution for this app for now.
